# repurrrsive

The repurrrsive package provides recursive lists that are handy when teaching or exampling functions such as `purrr::map()`. Datasets are stored as R list, JSON, and XML to provide the full non-rectangular data experience. Enjoy!

Package also includes the main data frame from the [gapminder package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gapminder) in 3 different forms: simple data frame (no list-columns), data frame nested by country, and split into a named list of data frames.

repurrrsive is used in this purrr tutorial:

<https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/>

## Installation

You can install repurrrsive from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jennybc/repurrrsive")
```

## Recursive list examples

#### wesanderson color palettes

`wesanderson` is the simplest list, containing color palettes, from the [wesanderson package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=wesanderson). Here's a glimpse: one component per palette, each containing a character vector of hex colors. *Screenshot is of the [listviewer](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=listviewer) htmlwidget.*

![](img/wesanderson-listviewer-jsonedit.png)

```{r}
library(repurrrsive)
library(purrr)
wesanderson[1:3]
```

Use `wesanderson` to demonstrate mapping functions over a list.

```{r}
map_chr(wesanderson, 1)
map_int(wesanderson, length)
map_chr(wesanderson[7:9], paste, collapse = ", ")
```

The same `wesanderson` data is also present as JSON and XML files. Accessor functions provide the local file path.

```{r}
wesanderson_json()
wesanderson_xml()
```

Practice bringing data from JSON into an R list.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
json <- fromJSON(wesanderson_json())
json$wesanderson[1:3]
identical(wesanderson, json$wesanderson)
```

Practice bringing data into R from XML. You can get it into an R list with `xml2::as_list()`, but to get a list as nice as those above? That requires a bit more work. Such is XML life.

```{r}
library(xml2)
xml <- read_xml(wesanderson_xml())
xml_child(xml)
as_list(xml_child(xml))
```

#### Game of Thrones POV characters

`got_chars` is a list with information on the 29 point-of-view characters from the first five books in the Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin. Retrieved from [An API Of Ice And Fire](https://anapioficeandfire.com).

```{r}
library(purrr)
(nms <- map_chr(got_chars, "name"))
map_df(got_chars, `[`, c("name", "gender", "culture", "born"))
```

The same `got_chars` data is also present as JSON and XML files. Accessor functions provide the local file path.

```{r}
got_chars_json()
got_chars_xml()
```

Practice bringing data from JSON into an R list.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
json <- fromJSON(got_chars_json(), simplifyDataFrame = FALSE)
json[[1]][c("name", "titles", "playedBy")]
identical(got_chars, json)
```

Practice bringing data into R from XML. You can get it into an R list with `xml2::as_list()`, but to get a list as nice as those above? That requires a bit more work. Such is XML life.

```{r}
library(xml2)
xml <- read_xml(got_chars_xml())
xml_child(xml)
```

#### GitHub user and repo data

`gh_users` and `gh_repos` are lists with information for 6 GitHub users and up to 30 of each user's repositories.

GitHub users.

```{r}
library(purrr)
map_chr(gh_users, "login")
map_chr(gh_users, 18)
map_df(gh_users, `[`, c("login", "name", "id", "location"))
```

First ~30 repos of these users. Peek at some info from first repo for the first user. Get full name of each user's 11th repo.

```{r}
str(gh_repos[[1]][[1]][c("full_name", "html_url", "description")])
map_chr(gh_repos, list(11, "full_name"))
```

Want to parse it yourself? Paths to local JSON and XML files.

```{r}
c(gh_users_json(), gh_repos_json(), gh_users_xml(), gh_repos_xml())
```

Redo this: Get full name of each user's 11th repo. But using only the XML.

```{r}
library(xml2)
repo_xml <- read_xml(gh_repos_xml())
repo_names <- map_chr(xml_find_all(repo_xml, "//full_name"), xml_text)
elevenses <- 
  11 + cumsum(c(0, head(table(gsub("(.*)/.*", "\\1", repo_names)), -1)))
repo_names[elevenses]
```

#### Star Wars Universe entities

`sw_people`, `sw_films`, `sw_species`, `sw_planets`, `sw_starships` and `sw_vehicles` are interrelated lists about entities in the Star Wars Universe retrieved from the [Star Wars API](http://swapi.co) using the package [`rwars`](https://github.com/Ironholds/rwars).

```{r}
library(purrr)
map_chr(sw_films, "title") 
```

Elements that contain URLs provide a way to link the lists together.  For example, the `films` element of each person contains URLs for the films they have appeared in.  For example, Luke Skywalker has been in five films.
```{r}
luke <- sw_people[[1]]
names(luke)
luke[["films"]]
```

These URLs can be looked up in the the `sw_films` list to find the titles of the films.
```{r}
# Create a mapping between titles and urls
film_lookup <- map_chr(sw_films, "title") %>% 
  set_names(map_chr(sw_films, "url"))

# The films Luke is in
film_lookup[luke[["films"]]] %>% unname()
```

## Nested and split data frame examples

Use the Gapminder data in various forms to practice different styles of grouped computation.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(tibble)

## group_by() + summarize()
gap_simple %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(cor = cor(lifeExp, year))

## nest() + map_*() inside mutate()
gap_nested %>%
  mutate(cor = data %>% map_dbl(~ cor(.x$lifeExp, .x$year)))

## split + map_*()
gap_split %>% 
  map_dbl(~ cor(.x$lifeExp, .x$year)) %>% 
  head()

## split + map_*() + tibble::enframe()
gap_split %>% 
  map_dbl(~ cor(.x$lifeExp, .x$year)) %>% 
  enframe()
```
